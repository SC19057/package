Description: Two R functions and a cpp function are involved in the package. One R function is used to compute the k-nearest neighbor density estimation 
             and the other R function is used to test indenpence under kernel density estimation and bootstap method. The cpp function is a random walk Metropolis sampler for generating the standard Laplace distribution.
             Besides, to use these functions, make sure you've installed R_package "FNN" and "kedd".
